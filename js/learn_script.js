    `<h2>Simple Present Tense</h2>
    <p>The simple present tense is one of several forms of present tense in English. It is used to describe <strong>habits, unchanging situations, general truths, and fixed arrangements</strong>. The simple present tense is simple to form. Just use the base form of the verb: (I take, you take, we take, they take) The 3rd person singular takes an -s at the end. (he takes, she takes)</p>
<h3>The simple present tense is used:</h3>
<ul>
<li>To express habits, general truths, repeated actions or unchanging situations, emotions and wishes:<br><strong>I smoke</strong> (habit); <strong>I work in London</strong> (unchanging situation); <strong>London is a large city</strong> (general truth)</li>
<li>To give instructions or directions:<br><strong>You walk</strong> for two hundred meters, then <strong>you turn</strong> left.</li>
<li>To express fixed arrangements, present or future:<br>Your exam <strong>starts</strong> at 09.00</li>
<li>To express future time, after some conjunctions: <strong><em>after, when, before, as soon as, until</em>:<br>He'll give it to you when <strong>you come</strong> next Saturday.</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-danger"><strong><strong>Be careful!</strong> The simple present is not used to express actions happening now.</strong></div>

<h3>Notes on the simple present, third person singular</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the third person singular the verb <strong>always ends in -s</strong>:<br><em>he want<strong>s</strong>, she need<strong>s</strong>, he give<strong>s</strong>, she think<strong>s.</strong></em></li>
<li>Negative and question forms use DOES (= the third person of the auxiliary 'DO') + the infinitive of the verb.<br><em>He want<strong>s</strong> ice cream. <strong>Does</strong> he want strawberry? He <strong>does</strong> not want vanilla.</em></li>
<li>Verbs ending in <strong>-y</strong> : the third person changes the <strong>-y</strong> to <strong>-ies</strong>:<br><em>fly --&gt; fl<strong>ies</strong>, cry --&gt; cr<strong>ies</strong></em><br><strong>Exception</strong>: if there is a vowel before the -<strong>y</strong>:<br><em>play --&gt; play<strong>s</strong>, pray --&gt; pray<strong>s</strong></em></li>
<li>Add <strong>-es</strong> to verbs ending in:<strong>-ss, -x, -sh, -ch</strong>:<br><em>he pass<strong>es, </strong>she catch<strong>es, </strong>he fix<strong>es, </strong>it push<strong>es</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>He goes</strong> to school every morning.</li>
<li><strong>She understands</strong> English.</li>
<li><strong>It mixes</strong> the sand and the water.</li>
<li><strong>He tries</strong> very hard.</li>
<li><strong>She enjoys</strong> playing the piano.</li>
</ul>
</div>`,

    `<h2>Simple Past Tense</h2>
    <div class="field-item even">
<p>The simple past tense, sometimes called the preterite, is used to talk about a <strong>completed action</strong> in a time <strong>before now</strong>. The simple past is the basic form of past tense in English. The time of the action can be in the recent past or the distant past and action duration is not important.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li>John Cabot <strong>sailed</strong> to America in 1498.</li>
<li>My father <strong>died</strong> last year.</li>
<li>He <strong>lived</strong> in Fiji in 1976.</li>
<li>We <strong>crossed</strong> the Channel yesterday.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You always use the simple past when you say <strong>when</strong> something happened, so it is associated with certain past time expressions</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>frequency</strong>: <em>often, sometimes, always</em><br>I sometimes <strong>walked</strong> home at lunchtime.<br>I often <strong>brought</strong> my lunch to school.</li>
<li><strong>a definite point in time</strong>: <em>last week, when I was a child, yesterday, six weeks ago</em><br>We <strong>saw</strong> a good film <em>last week</em>.<br><em>Yesterday</em>, I <strong>arrived</strong> in Geneva.<br>She <strong>finished</strong> her work at<em>seven o'clock</em><br>I <strong>went</strong> to the theatre <em>last night </em></li>
<li><strong>an indefinite point in time</strong>: <em>the other day, ages ago, a long time ago</em><br>People <strong>lived</strong> in caves a <em>long time ago</em>.<br>She <strong>played</strong> the piano <em>when she was a child</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the word <em>ago</em> is a useful way of expressing the distance into the past. It is placed <strong>after</strong> the period of time: <em>a week ago, three years ago, a minute ago</em>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger">Be Careful: The simple past in English may look like a tense in your own language, but the meaning may be different.</div>

<h3>Notes on affirmative, negative, &amp; interrogative forms</h3>
<h6>Affirmative</h6>
<p>The affirmative of the simple past tense is simple.</p>
<ul>
<li>I <strong>was</strong> in Japan last year</li>
<li>She <strong>had</strong> a headache yesterday.</li>
<li>We <strong>did</strong> our homework last night.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Negative and interrogative</h6>
<p>For the negative and interrogative simple past form of <em>"to do"</em> as an ordinary verb, use the auxiliary <em>"did",</em> e.g. We <strong>didn't do</strong> our homework last night.<br>The negative of <em>"have"</em> in the simple past is usually formed using the auxiliary <em>"did"</em>, but sometimes by simply adding <em>not</em> or the contraction <em>"n't"</em>.</p>
<p>The interrogative form of <em>"have"</em> in the simple past normally uses the auxiliary <em>"did".</em></p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li>They <strong>weren't</strong> in Rio last summer.</li>
<li>We <strong>didn't have</strong> any money.</li>
<li>We <strong>didn't have</strong> time to visit the Eiffel Tower.</li>
<li>We <strong>didn't do</strong> our exercises this morning.</li>
<li><strong>Were</strong> they in Iceland last January?</li>
<li><strong>Did you have</strong> a bicycle when you were young?</li>
<li><strong>Did you do</strong> much climbing in Switzerland?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For the negative and interrogative form of <strong>all</strong> verbs in the simple past, always use the auxiliary <strong><em>'did</em>''.</strong></p>
<h3>Simple past, irregular verbs</h3>
<p>Some verbs are irregular in the simple past. Here are the most common ones.</p>
<h6>to go</h6>
<ul>
<li>He <strong>went</strong> to a club last night.</li>

    `<h2>Simple Future Tense</h2>
    <div class="field-item even">
<h3>Functions of the simple future tense</h3>
<p>The simple future refers to a time later than now, and expresses facts or certainty. In this case there is no 'attitude'.</p>
<p><strong>The simple future is used:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To predict a future event:<br>It <strong>will rain</strong> tomorrow.</li>
<li>With I or We, to express a spontaneous decision:<br><strong>I'll pay</strong> for the tickets by credit card.</li>
<li>To express willingness:<br><strong>I'll do</strong> the washing-up.<br><strong>He'll carry</strong> your bag for you.</li>
<li>In the negative form, to express unwillingness:<br>The baby <strong>won't eat</strong> his soup.<br>I <strong>won't leave</strong> until I've seen the manager!</li>
<li>With I in the interrogative form using "shall", to make an offer:<br><strong>Shall I open</strong> the window?</li>
<li>With we in the interrogative form using "shall", to make a suggestion:<br><strong>Shall we go</strong> to the cinema tonight?</li>
<li>With I in the interrogative form using "shall", to ask for advice or instructions:<br>What <strong>shall I tell</strong> the boss about this money?</li>
<li>With you, to give orders:<br>You <strong>will do</strong> exactly as I say.</li>
<li>With you in the interrogative form, to give an invitation:<br><strong>Will you come</strong> to the dance with me?<br><strong>Will you marry</strong> me?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>In modern English <strong>will</strong> is preferred to <strong>shall</strong>. Shall is mainly used with <strong>I</strong> and <strong>we</strong> to make an offer or suggestion, or to ask for advice (see examples above). With the other persons (you, he, she, they) shall is only used in literary or poetic situations, e.g. <em>"With rings on her fingers and bells on her toes, She <strong>shall have</strong> music wherever she goes."</em></p>
<h3>Forming the simple future</h3>

<h3>Functions of the present continuous</h3>
<p>As with all tenses in English, the <strong><em>speaker's attitude </em></strong>is as important as the time of the action or event. When someone uses the present continuous, they are thinking about something that is <em><strong>unfinished or incomplete</strong></em></p>
<h5>The present continuous is used:</h5>
<ul>
<li>to describe an action that is going on at this moment: <em><strong>You are using </strong>the Internet</em>. <em><strong>You are studying</strong> English grammar.</em></li>
<li>to describe an action that is going on during this period of time or a trend: <em><strong>Are you still working</strong> for the same company? More and more people <strong>are becoming</strong> vegetarian.</em></li>
<li>to describe an action or event in the future, which has already been planned or prepared: <em><strong>We're going</strong> on holiday tomorrow</em>. <em><strong>I'm meeting</strong> my boyfriend tonight</em>. <em><strong>Are they visiting</strong></em> you next winter?</li>
<li>to describe a temporary event or situation: <em>He usually plays the drums, but <strong>he's playing</strong> bass guitar tonight</em>. <em>The weather forecast was good, but <strong>it's raining</strong> at the moment. </em></li>
<li>with "always, forever, constantly", to describe and emphasise a continuing series of repeated actions: <em>Harry and Sally <strong>are always arguing</strong>! <strong>You're constantly complaining</strong> about your mother-in-law!</em></li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Be careful:</strong> Some verbs are not usually used in the continuous form</div>

<h3>Functions of the past continuous</h3>
<p>The past continuous describes actions or events in a time <strong>before now</strong>, which began in the past and were&nbsp;<strong>still going on</strong> when another event occurred.</p>
<p><strong>It is used:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Often, to describe the background in a story written in the past tense, e.g. "The sun <strong>was shining</strong> and the birds <strong>were singing</strong> as the elephant came out of the jungle. The other animals <strong>were relaxing</strong> in the shade of the trees, but the elephant moved very quickly. She <strong>was looking</strong> for her baby, and she didn't notice the hunter who <strong>was watching</strong> her through his binoculars.

<li>to describe an unfinished action that was interrupted by another event or action, e.g. "I <strong>was having</strong> a beautiful dream when the alarm clock rang."</li>
<li>to express a change of mind: e.g. "I <strong>was going</strong> to spend the day at the beach but I've decided to get my homework done instead."</li>
<li>with <em>'wonder'</em>, to make a very polite request: e.g. "I <strong>was wondering</strong> if you could baby-sit for me tonight."</li>

<p>The future continuous refers to an unfinished action or event that will be in progress at a time later than now. The future continuous is used for quite a few different purposes.</p>
<p>The future continuous can be used to project ourselves into the future.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li>This time next week <strong>I will be sun-bathing</strong> in Bali.</li>
<li>By Christmas <strong>I will be skiing</strong> like a pro.</li>
<li>Just think, next Monday <strong>you will be working</strong> in your new job.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The future continuous can be used for predicting or guessing about future events.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>He'll be coming</strong> to the meeting, I expect.</li>
<li>I guess <strong>you'll be feeling</strong> thirsty after working in the sun.</li>
<li><strong>You'll be missing</strong> the sunshine once you're back in England.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In the interrogative form, the future continuous can be used to ask politely for information about the future.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Will you be bringing</strong> your friend to the pub tonight?</li>
<li><strong>Will Jim be coming</strong> with us?</li>
<li><strong>Will she be going</strong> to the party tonight?</li>
<li><strong>Will I be sleeping</strong> in this room?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The future continuous can be used to refer to continuous events that we expect to happen in the future.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li>I'll be seeing Jim at the conference next week.</li>
<li>When he is in Australia <strong>he will be staying</strong> with friends.</li>
<li><strong>I'll be eating</strong> with Jane this evening so I can tell her.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When combined with <em>still</em>, the future continuous refers to events that are already happening now and that we expect to continue some time into the future.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li>In an hour <strong>I'll still be ironing</strong> my clothes.</li>
<li>Tomorrow <strong>he'll still be suffering</strong> from his cold.</li>
<li>Next year <strong>will she still be wearing</strong> a size six?</li>
<li><strong>Won't stock prices still be falling</strong> in the morning?</li>
<li>Unfortunately, <strong>sea levels will still be rising</strong> in 20 years.</li>
</ul>

    `<h2>Present Perfect Tense</h2>
    <div class="field-item even">
<h3>Definition of the present perfect tense</h3>
<p>The present perfect is used to indicate a link between the present and the past. The time of the action is <strong>before now but not specified</strong>, and we are often more interested in the <strong>result</strong> than in the action itself.</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger"><strong>BE CAREFUL!</strong> There may be a verb tense in your language with a similar form, but the meaning is probably NOT the same.</div>
<h6>The present perfect is used to describe</h6>
<ul>
<li>An action or situation that started in the past and continues in the present. <em>I <strong>have lived</strong> in Bristol since 1984 </em>(= and I still do.)</li>
<li>An action performed during a period that has not yet finished. <em>She <strong>has been </strong>to the cinema twice this week </em> (= and the week isn't over yet.)</li>
<li>A repeated action in an unspecified period between the past and now. <em>We <strong>have visited</strong> Portugal several times.</em></li>
<li>An action that was completed in the very recent past, expressed by 'just'. <em> I <strong>have just finished</strong> my work.</em></li>
<li>An action when the time is not important. <em>He <strong>has read</strong> 'War and Peace'. </em>(= the result of his reading is important)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When we want to give or ask details about when, where, who, we use the simple past.

<h3>Forming the present perfect</h3>
<p>The present perfect of any verb is composed of two elements : the appropriate form of the auxiliary verb <strong><em>to have </em></strong>(present tense), plus the past participle of the main verb. The past participle of a regular verb is <strong><em>base</em>+ed</strong>, e.g. <em>played, arrived, looked</em>. For irregular verbs, see the <strong>Table of irregular verbs</strong> in the section called <strong>'Verbs'</strong>.</p>

<h3>Function</h3>
<p>The future perfect tense refers to a completed action in the future. When we use this tense we are projecting ourselves forward into the future and looking back at an action that will be completed some time later than now. It is most often used with a time expression.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">

<h6>Actions that started in the past and continue in the present</h6>
<p>She <strong>has been waiting</strong> for you all day (= and she's still waiting now).<br><strong>I've been working</strong> on this report since eight o'clock this morning (= and I still haven't finished it).<br><strong>They have been travelling</strong> since last October (= and they're not home yet).</p>

<h3>Verbs without continuous forms</h3>
<p>With verbs not normally used in the continuous form, use the simple present perfect instead (verbs such as: know, hate, hear, understand, want).<br><strong>I've wanted</strong> to visit China for years.<br><strong>She's known</strong> Robert since she was a child.<br><strong>I've hated</strong> that music since I first heard it.<br><strong>I've heard</strong> a lot about you recently.<br><strong>We've understood</strong> everything.</p>

<h3>Functions of the past perfect continuous</h3>
<p>The past perfect continuous corresponds to the present perfect continuous, but with reference to a time earlier than 'before now'. As with the present perfect continuous, we are more interested in the <strong>process</strong>.</p>

<li>Her friends <strong>had been thinking</strong> of calling the police when she walked in.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This form is also used in <strong>reported speech</strong>. It is the equivalent of the past continuous and the present perfect continuous in direct speech:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jane said, "I have been gardening all afternoon." = Jane said <strong>she had been gardening</strong> all afternoon.</li>
<li>When the police questioned him, John said, "I was working late in the office that night." = When the police questioned him, John told them <strong>he had been working</strong> late in the office that night.</li>

<h3>Function</h3>
<p>Like the future perfect simple, this form is used to project ourselves forward in time and to look back. It refers to events or actions that are currently unfinished but will be finished at some future time. It is most often used with a time expression.</p>

    `<h2>Active/Passive Voice</h2>
    <div class="field-item even">
<h3>Functions of the passive voice</h3>
<p>The passive voice is used to show interest in the person or object that experiences an action rather than the person or object that performs the action. In other words, the most important thing or person becomes the subject of the sentence.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li>The passive voice <strong>is used</strong> frequently. (= we are interested in the passive voice, not in who uses it.)</li>
<li>The house <strong>was built</strong> in 1654. (= we are interested in the house, not in who built it.)</li>
<li>The road<strong> is being repaired</strong>. (= we are interested in the road, not in the people who are doing the repairs.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Sometimes we use the passive voice because we don't know or do not want to express who performed the action.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li>I noticed that a window <strong>had been left</strong> open.</li>
<li>Every year thousands of people <strong>are killed</strong> on our roads.</li>
<li>All the cookies <strong>have been eaten</strong>.</li>
<li>My car <strong>has been stolen</strong>!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The passive voice is often used in formal texts. Switching to the active voice will make your writing clearer and easier to read.</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If we want to say who or what performs the action while using the passive voice, we use the preposition <em>by</em>. When we know who performed the action and are interested in him, it is always better to switch to the active voice instead.</p>

<h6>Passive voice with infinitives</h6>
<p>The infinitive passive voice is used after modal verbs and other most verbs normally followed by an infinitive.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li>You <strong>have to be tested</strong> on your English grammar.</li>
<li>John <strong>might be promoted</strong> next year.</li>
<li>She <strong>wants to be invited</strong> to the party.</li>
<li>I <strong>expect to be surprised</strong> on my birthday.</li>
<li>You <strong>may be disappointed</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h6>Passive voice with gerunds</h6>
<p>Gerunds are used after prepositions and verbs normally followed by a gerund.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li>I <strong>remember being taught</strong> to drive.</li>
<li>The children are excited <strong>about being taken</strong> to the zoo.</li>
<li>The children are excited <strong>to be taken</strong> to the zoo.</li>
<li>Most film stars <strong>hate being interviewed</strong>.</li>
<li>Most film stars <strong>hate to be interviewed</strong>.</li>
<li>Poodles <strong>like to be pampered</strong>.</li>
<li>Poodles <strong>like being pampered</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h6>Using "to be born"</h6>
<p>"To be born" is a passive form and is most commonly used in the past tense. However, in some cases, the present or future tense is appropriate.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li>I<strong> was born</strong> in 1976.</li>
<li>Where&nbsp;<strong>were you born</strong>?</li>
<li>Around 100 babies <strong>are born</strong> in this hospital every week.</li>
<li>We don't know on exactly which day the baby <strong>will be born</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Sometimes the passive is formed using the verb <em>to get</em> or <em>to have</em> instead of the verb <em>to be</em>. A separate page deals with these .</p>

    `<h2>Passive Voice part 2</h2>
    <div class="field-item even">
<p>Sentences written in the active voice are easier to understand than sentences written in the passive voice. Switching the passive voice into the active voice is straightforward, but it requires a bit of practice. In the equivalency table below, notice that the tense of the verb <em>to be</em> in the passive voice is always the same as the tense of the main verb in the active voice. In order to use the active voice, you will have to make the subject of the action explicit.</p>

    `<h2>Passive Voice part 3</h2>
    <div class="field-item even">
<p>You can form sentences that are passive in meaning but not in form by using <a href="/wwen/english-resources/english-grammar/verb-get/" data-clicklabel="page:page:/wwen/english-resources/english-grammar/verb-get/">the verb <em>to get</em></a> or the verb <em>to have</em> in place of the verb <em>to be</em>. These constructions often describe situations where we want someone else to do something for us or where we are going to hire someone else to do something for us. The subject is active, but he is only doing the "getting". It is the unnamed person who is gotten who will perform the action of the main verb in the sentence. That second person is not explicit in the sentence when the sentence has a passive meaning. We are more interested in the result of the activity than in the person that performs the activity.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li>I must <strong>get my hair cut.</strong></li>
<li>I must <strong>have my hair cut</strong>.</li>
<li>When are you going to <strong>get that window mended</strong>?</li>
<li>We're <strong>having the house painted</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This type of construction can refer to the completion of an activity, especially if a time expression is used.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li>We'll <strong>get the work done</strong> as soon as possible.</li>
<li>I'll <strong>get those letters typed</strong> before lunchtime.</li>
<li>She said she'd<strong> have my lunch delivered</strong> by noon.</li>
<li>You should <strong>have your roof repaired</strong> before next winter.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If the verb refers to something unwanted, it has the same meaning as a passive sentence.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li>Jim <strong>had his car stolen</strong> last night.</li>
<li>Jim's car <strong>was stolen</strong>.</li>
<li>They <strong>had their roof blown off</strong> in the storm.</li>
<li>Their roof <strong>was blown off</strong> in the storm.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h6>Using "to need" in passive constructions</h6>
<p>You can also use the verb <em>to need</em> followed by the gerund in an active construction with a passive meaning. The important thing in our minds in these sentences is the person or thing that will experience the action, not the person performing the action.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li>The ceiling <strong>needs painting</strong>.</li>
<li>The ceiling <strong>needs to be painted</strong>.</li>
<li>My hair <strong>needs cutting</strong>.</li>
<li>My hair <strong>needs to be cut</strong>.</li>
<li>That faucet <strong>needs fixing</strong>.</li>

        <td>An auxiliary verb helps the main (full) verb and is also called a "helping verb." With auxiliary verbs, you can write sentences in different tenses, moods, or voices. Auxiliary verbs are: <i>be, do, have, will, shall, would, should, can, could, may, might, must, ought,</i> etc. <br><br><ul><li>I think I <u>should</u> study harder to master English.</li><li>I <u>am</u> having a cup of coffee.</li><li>You <u>have been</u> practicing hard.</li><li>It <u>was</u> written by a petitioner.</li><li>You <u>may</u> choose what you like.</li></ul>The verb forms of <i>be, do, and have</i> can be used either as a main (full) verb or an auxiliary verb. The following examples show these verbs used as auxiliary verbs. <br><br>1. "Be" as an auxiliary verb<br><br>a.Used in progressive sentences:<br><br><ul><li>I am taking a bath.</li><li>She is preparing dinner for us.</li><li>They have been studying all night.</li></ul>b.Used in passive sentences:<br><br><ul><li>I was given a free meal.</li><li>He was seen by fans at the airport.</li><li>This song has been sung by all nations.</li></ul> 2."Do" as an auxiliary verb<br><br>a.

    `<h2>Conjunctive Adverbs</h2>
    <p>
    <td>Conjunctive adverbs are words that join independent clauses into one sentence. A conjunctive adverb helps you create a shorter sentence.<br><br>When you use a conjunctive adverb, put a semicolon (;) before it and a comma (,) after it. <br><br><ul><li>We have many different sizes of this shirt; <u>however</u>, it comes in only one color.</li></ul>Some examples of conjunctive adverbs are: <i>accordingly, also, besides, consequently, finally, however, indeed, instead, likewise, meanwhile, moreover, nevertheless, next, otherwise, still, therefore, then</i>, etc. <br><br><ul><li>The due date for the final paper has passed; <u>therefore</u>, I could not submit mine on time.</li><li>There are many history books; <u>however</u>, none of them may be accurate.</li><li>It rained hard; <u>moreover</u>, lightening flashed and thunder boomed.</li><li>The baby fell asleep; <u>then</u>, the doorbell rang.</li><li>The law does not permit drinking and driving anytime; <u>otherwise</u>, there would be many more accidents.</li></ul>Conjunctive adverbs look like coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, so, for, yet, nor); however, they are not as strong as coordinating conjunctions and they are punctuated differently.<br><br>A conjunctive adverb is also used in a single main clause. In this case, a comma (,) is used to separate the conjunctive adverb from the sentence. <br><br><ul><li>I woke up very late this morning. <u>Nevertheless</u>, I wasn’t late to school.</li><li>She didn’t take a bus to work today.  <u>Instead</u>, she drove her car.</li><li>Jack wants a toy car for his birthday. <u>Meanwhile</u>, Jill wants a dollhouse for her birthday.</li><li>They returned home. <u>Likewise</u>, I went home.</li></ul><br><b><font size="3">[Activity 1]</font></b><br><br>Choose the right conjunctive adverb for the sentence.<br><br>1)Hurry up; <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>, you will be late for the train. <br>2)I studied hard for the exam; <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>, I failed. <br>3)Tom is a sportsman; <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>, his brother Tom is athletic. <br>4)He didn’t go to college.  <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>, he started his own business. <br>5)He is not good-looking.  <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>, he is popular among girls.</td>
