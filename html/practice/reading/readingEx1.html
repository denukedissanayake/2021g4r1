                Thirteen-year-olds do not spend as much money as their parents
                suspect - at least not according to the findings of a __(1)__ survey,
                Money and Change. The survey __(2)__ three hundred teenagers, 13-
                17 years old, from __(3)__ Britain.

                weekly allowance rise dramatically to an amazing national average of
                Â£5.14. Two thirds think they get __(5)__ money, but most expect to
                have to do something to get it.
                Although they have more cash, worry about debt is __(6)__ among
                teenagers. Therefore, the __(7)__ of children __(8)__ an effort to save
                for the future.
                Greater access to cash __(9)__ teenagers does not, however,
                mean that they are more irresponsible __(10)__ a result. The economic
                recession seems to have encouraged __(11)__ attitudes to money,
                even in the case of children at these ages. Instead of wasting what
                pocket __(12)__ they have on sweets or magazines, the 13-year-olds
                who took __(13)__ in the survey seem to __(14)__ to the situation by
                saving more than half __(15)__ their cash.
