                found it __(1)__ as the door was old and rusty. As she __(2)__ opened
                the door, it squeaked __(3)__ on its old hinges. ‘I wish they’d oil the

                she got home. No sooner had she put her foot on the first stair __(15)__
                she heard a muffled voice call out, ‘Who’s there? Is that you, Helen?
