                A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either
                admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent
                with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his
                hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in
                consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he
                would never have achieved his present wealth.
                Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a
                present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness
                with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more
                worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into
                joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the
                milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of
                buying something she can’t really afford .
                As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but
                when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

                <li>Answer: Option 3 <br>
                    This is the most appropriate title as the author sheds light on the life of a rich person in the
                    first paragraph and discusses the life of a person who belongs to lower strata of the society in the
                    second paragraph.

                    The meaning of the word “hospitality” is the quality or disposition of receiving and treating guests
                    and strangers in a warm, friendly, generous way which justifies that option d is the correct answer
                    choice.

                <li>

                    Answer: Option 1<br>
                    The word “equanimity” means mental or emotional stability or composure, especially under tension or
                    strain as can further be understood as in this example “Raj was a man of great equanimity, even when
                    talking about his own death.”
