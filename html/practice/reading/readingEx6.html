                Political education has many connotations. It may be defined as the preparation of a citizen to take
                well informed, responsible and sustained action for participation in the national struggle in order to
                achieve the socio-economic objectives of the country. The predominant socio- economic objectives in
                India are the abolition of poverty and the creation of a modern democratic, secular and socialist
                society in place of the present traditional, feudal, hierarchical and in egalitarian one.
                Under the colonial rule, the Congress leaders argued that political education was an important part of
                education and refused to accept the official view that education and politics should not be mixed with
                one another. But when they came to power in 1948 they almost adopted the British policy and began to
                talk of education being defiled by politics. ‘Hands off education’ was the call to political parties.
                But in spite of it, political infiltration into the educational system has greatly increased in the
                sense that different political parties vie with each other to capture the mind of teachers and students.
                The wise academicians wanted political support, without political interference. What we have actually
                received is infinite political interference with little genuine political support. This interference
                with the educational system by political parties for their own ulterior motives is no political
                education at all and with the all round growth of elitism, it is hardly a matter for surprise that real
                political education within the school system (which really means the creation of a commitment to social
                transformation) has been even weaker than in the pre-independence period.
                During that time only, the struggle for freedom came to an end and the major non- formal agency of
                political education disappeared. The press played a major role by providing some political education.
                But it did not utilize the opportunity to the full and the strangle hold of vested interests continued
                to dominate it. The same can be said of political parties as well as of other institutions and agencies
                outside the school system which can be expected to provide political education. After analyzing all
                these things , it appears that we have made no progress in genuine political education in the
                post-education period and have even slided back in some respects. For instance, the education system has
                become even more elite-oriented. Patriotism has become the first casualty. The father of the nation gave
                us the courage to oppose government when it was wrong, in a disciplined fashion and on basic principles.
                Today, we have even lost the courage to fight on basic issues in a disciplined manner because
                agitational and anarchic politics for individual, group or party aggrandizement has become common. In
                the recent times the education system continues to support domination of the privileged groups and
                domestication of the under- privileged ones. The situation will not change unless we take vigorous steps
                to provide genuine political education on an adequate scale. This is one of the major educational
                reforms we need, and if it is not carried out, mere linear expansion of the existing system of formal
                education will only support the status quo and hamper radical social transformation.
