                If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally
                great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in
                fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act
                more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden
                extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men
                at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift
                decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted
                with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so
                debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the
                mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful
                strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a
                kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon,
                lifted me for a time above myself.

                <li>Answer: Option 2<br>
                    This best captures the essence of the passage. In case one is faced with sudden danger, even the man
                    who is shy gets the courage to face the situation as it has further been discussed in the lines
                    “Frequently in cases.......in nature.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    Answer: Option 3 <br>
                    The paragraph clearly identifies 3 ways:
                    Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright
                    or to lift a hand in defense of our lives,
                    and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational
                    beings.
                    On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight,
                    and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of
                    the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Answer: Option 1<br>
                    The word “enfeeble” means to make weak or feeble.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Answer: Option 2<br>
                    It means that in times of difficulty one gathers courage to make decisions. The word ‘resolution’
                    means the act of resolving or determining upon an action or course of action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Answer: Option 2<br>
                    It is mentioned in the last few lines.
