                One commonality among everyone in the whole world is that they learned to speak before they learned
                grammar. Speaking is the first step for any English learner. So if you are a novice at English, please
                focus on your speaking and listening skills prior to studying grammar. After being able to speak English
                fluently, you will realize how much easier grammar is. But it does not work the other way around. Being
                fluent in English speaking will help you with your grammar studies, but studying grammar will NOT help
                you with your speaking.

                In this article, the four most basic grammar topics are explained, which consists of 1) subject, 2)
                predicate, 3) verb, and 4) article. This is the absolute minimum you should know. After you become
                comfortable with speaking, then you can study more advanced grammar topics. For now, please review and
                study the four items described below.
